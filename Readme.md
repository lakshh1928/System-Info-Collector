*System Info Collector*

A simple project to collect system information from remote machines using Ansible and a custom shell script (sysinfo.sh).

# The admin can run a playbook to: 
- Copy the sysinfo.sh script from the repo to a target machine.
- Execute the script remotely.
- Print system information (CPU, memory, disk, uptime, etc.) of the userâ€™s machine.
